Right-Angle Triangles  A right angle triangle means there is one angle that is exactly 90°. The side opposite to the right angle is called the Hypotenuse (C). The hypotenuse is the longest side in the right-angled triangle.  For all right angle triangles, you can use the Pythagorean Theorem ( ) to solve for unknown lengths.
